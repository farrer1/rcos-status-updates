## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week, I began a tutorial document with the intent of explaining the key functions and files of AGENCY. This document lists all functions contained within a given
file, and describes the effect of each of them. To help with this, I have continued studying Javascript, PHP, and SQL, so that I can properly explain what the code does.
Additionally, I did some preliminary reasearch into unit testing.

## This Week's Plan

My plans are to continue with this new tutorial document, while continuing to add to the bug tracking document I had previously created. By logging bugs in the code
I am describing, I can tackle both tasks at once. Additionally, I will continue to research the relevant programming langugages, as well as unit testing.

## Anything Blocking?

As always, we lack an installation of the program. However, nothing in particular is blocking the tasks that I have set for myself above.
