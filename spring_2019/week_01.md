## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I assisted other members of the team in installing AGENCY to a PostgreSQL server, and made note of the location of several Fix Me comments
in the code of AGENCY. I also documented the steps taken in installing AGENCY so far, with the goal of creating a new installation guide.

## This Week's Plan

I plan on continuing to track Fix Me comments in the code, in order to create a comprehensive issue tracker. Once progress is made on that, I will start writing
a test suite for the code base. I also intend to continue work on the new AGENCY installation guide.

## Anything Blocking?

The team has yet to be able to install the program, so there's still a lot missing from our understanding of it. Therefore, it's difficult to begin planning or writing
a test suite for the code base, because the expected behavior is still unknown.
