## Last Week's Accomplishments
This past week, I made further progress on planning unit tests for the Auth class.
I also spent some time gaining familiarity with PHPUnit by writing a simple class and some tests for it, so that I know how to sue it for this project.
Beyond those two points, the rest of my time was spent working on the final presentation.

## This Week's Plan
I plan to give the final presentation with my group, and hopefully finish planning unit tests for the Auth class.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing in particular.

## Notes
Over the course of this semester, I spent most of my time reading the code and writing documentation for it.
As a result of these efforts, I've produced some new, more detailed documentation for some of the files that make up AGENCY, so that future
members of the project can be onboarded more quickly than we were as the first RCOS group to work on this.
