## Last Week's Accomplishments

I spent the past week studying up on PHP and SQL, so that I am better able to understand the code as I read through it and study it.
I also spoke with the original creator of AGENCY, Ken, to discuss how to go about implementing automatic unit testing for the program, and how to improve documentation.

## This Week's Plan

My plans are largely the same as last week. I will, in addition to studying the code and relevant programming languages, begin looking into how to implement unit tests
for complicated projects such as this one. To do so, I will look for examples of similar projects of similar scope, and examine how they go about testing
the user interface and background processes.

## Anything Blocking?

The lack of an installation of the project is still an issue, but restructuring of the project subgroups has enabled us to start making progress
in other regards, and study of the code has further mitigated the blocking of our unfamiliarity.
