## Last Week's Accomplishments
This week, I did not make as much progress as I had hoped to. I have done some more work on documenting the code and tracking bugs,
but in terms of unit testing, all that has gotten done is more research.
However, I did also make significant contributions to the group presentation, creating the slideshow and filling out several slides of it.

## This Week's Plan
This week, I plan on making the progress on unit testing that I had wanted to make this past week.
Beyond this, I plan to continue the usual documentation work, and to practice for the group presentation.

## Anything Blocking?
Progress was slow this week due to large assignments being due in several of my other classes. I do not expect this continue to block progress moving forwards.
