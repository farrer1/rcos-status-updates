## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week, I found a class file in AGENCY. This is significant for my unit testing efforts, as it provides something of a foot in the door in terms of understanding the
code and actually writing some tests. I have begun looking more specifically into class-based unit testing in PHP, so that I can test this class in isolation.
Beyond that, I have continued my usual work in code documentation and bug tracking. I've also downloaded PHPUnit after some research, which appears to be the leading
framework for unit testing in PHP.

## This Week's Plan
I plan on devoting most of my efforts into developing unit tests for the Auth class that I have found in the code. Code documentation will likely take second priority,
and bug tracking will see little progress beyond the potential addition of any bugs that unit testing may reveal. I intend to not move on in any of these three categories
until they are all complete for the Auth class, leaving it fully documented.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing is blocking my progress at this point in time.

## Notes
I have finally found something I can write code for! I've never written code in PHP before, but I'm glad that I'm not going to go the whole semester doing
nothing but reading and documenting the code.
