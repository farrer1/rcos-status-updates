## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week, I continued writing the documentation that I have been working on for the past several weeks. I did not start any new tasks, but the codes
explanation document is proceding nicely. I also reorganized it somewhat, to improve readability and make it more clear how the different files
relate to one another. I also made some progress in researching unit testing.

## This Week's Plan

I will continue to add to the documentation that I have been working on. I also hope to start over on writing pseudocode unit tests, with my
new and improved understanding of how testing works for projects of this nature.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing is blocking my current tasks, except perhaps continued difficulties with the nature of unit testing for this project.
