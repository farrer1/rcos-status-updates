## Last Week's Accomplishments
This week, I updated the group slideshow for our presentation to be more in line with the guidelines presented at the last large group meeting.
This involved condensing information spread across multiple slides into one slide, to make sure we didn't run up against our time limit.
I also made progress on the unit testing for the Auth class. Most class functions now have a written test plan for them.

## This Week's Plan
I plan to finish writing the written test plans for the Auth class, and to begin experimenting with how to implement them in PHPUnit.
I also plan to determine whether or not all the unit tests will be doable in isolation, or if the Auth class has dependencies that
will make that impossible.

## Anything Blocking?
Nothing in particular.
