## Last Week's Accomplishments

I spent the past week adding to the issue tracker, and further studying the code. I referred to several PHP and SQL tutorials to enhance my understanding,
and created more pseudocode unit test cases. I also contributed to a group meeting in which we significantly restructured out project organization, and took
on the role of helping others understand the code and enhancing the code's documentation.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to continue adding to the issue tracker. Additionally, I plan to conitnue studying the code, and adding comments where I feel my understanding
is strong enough to do so. I will also continue planning unit tests, although converting them to actual code will be delayed as the group
focuses on understanding what code is already there.

## Anything Blocking?

The lack of an installation of the project is still an issue, but restructuring of the project subgroups has enabled us to start making progress
in other regards, and study of the code has further mitigated the blocking of our unfamiliarity.
