## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week, I spent most of my time adding to the issue tracking document I created last week, adding over 70 issues and
bug reports. I also began planning unit tests for the codebase in pseudocode.

## This Week's Plan

I plan to continue adding to the issue tracker. I also plan to write more pseudocode tests, and begin work on translating
them into tests in the appropriate languages for the project.

## Anything Blocking?

We still do not have a working installation of the program, so there are still difficulties in ascertaining the expected
behavior of the code. A lack of familiarity with the languages of the program also blocks progress, but continued study of
the code is starting to mitigate that issue.
